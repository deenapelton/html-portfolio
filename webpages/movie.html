<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie because of the love story. My favorite part was how he would read to his wife everyday hoping she would remember him.</p>
<h3>The Neverending Story</h3>
<p>This was my favorite movie as a kid. I loved how it was a fantasy book that came to life.

<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>I can't pick just one! I love the whole saga. I love space fantasy movies.</p>
